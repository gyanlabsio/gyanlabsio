## 🧠 About

**GyanLabs** is an independent engineering studio and product lab operated by a single engineer.

I build **reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems**, with a strong focus on clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability.

This space exists to:
- ship real systems  
- design clean architectures  
- document decisions and learnings  
- experiment responsibly  
- build foundations for long-term products  

This is not a résumé.  
It’s a **working lab**.

---

## ⚙️ What I Build

- **Full-stack web applications**  
  End-to-end products designed to grow without collapsing under complexity.

- **Backend systems & APIs**  
  Stable interfaces, clean data models, and systems built for real-world usage.

- **Automation & intelligent workflows**  
  Practical automation that reduces manual effort and operational noise.

- **System design & architecture**  
  Turning unclear ideas into structured, extensible systems.

---

## 🛠 Now Building

> This section evolves with the work.

- Internal tools for faster, safer delivery  
- Reusable backend and API foundations  
- Automation pipelines used in real workflows  
- Client systems (shared selectively)

Public repositories reflect **working systems**, not demos or placeholders.

---

## 🧭 How I Work

- I understand the problem before choosing tools  
- I prefer simple, boring solutions that scale  
- I balance short-term delivery with long-term system health  
- Every project feeds future systems and decisions  

> **Efficiency is not speed.**  
> **Efficiency is removing future failure modes.**

## 📂 Work & Repositories

Pinned repositories highlight:
- real systems  
- architectural decisions  
- reusable patterns  
- documented thinking  

This is not a highlight reel.  
It’s a **workbench**.

## 📓 From the Lab

<p align="center">

</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>📘 Notes & Decisions</strong></summary>

- Architecture notes are published when they teach something useful  
- Case studies appear only when outcomes are real  
- Experiments are shared when they reveal insight  

This space grows through work, not announcements.

## 📐 Principles

- Systems over hacks  
- Clarity over noise  
- Efficiency over excess  
- Learning through building
